# SentinelOne Queries
This will be a repository of SentinelOne Deep Visibility queries both the standard queries and the Power Queries.

## Info
This repository will mainly contain YAML files with it divided by Operating System and the type of queries. This repository and many YAML files were inspiured by [Sentinelone-Queries](https://github.com/keyboardcrunch/sentinelone-queries) and [Sysmon-Config](https://github.com/ion-storm/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml).
Not all rules/queries will be mapped at to the MITRE ATTACK Framework. 

## Abbreviations
Below are some of the abbreviations I may use throughout this repository.

S1 = SentinelOne
DV = Deep Visibility
PQ = Power Query

## Side Note
I'm still learning how to create rules and queries and not all of these have been tested.
As of writing this, most of the rules/queries should have a low false positive rate. (At least in my environment.)
This is still a work in progess and will be updated off and on.
